I am a High Performance Computing Architecture Researcher at AMD Research and Advanced Development. My research interests include performance profiling and modeling, memory subsystems, CPU microarchitecture, and hardware security. At AMD, I also help organize Tech Talks where we invite external speakers to present their work to AMD folks. <font color = "#9900FF">Please reach out to me if you are interested in giving a Tech Talk!</font>

I received my PhD from the Schoool of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta in 2022, advised by [Prof. Milos Prvulovic](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~milos/) and [Prof. Alenka Zajic](https://alenka.ece.gatech.edu/). For my thesis, I worked on securing embedded and IoT devices by profiling and monitoring architectural events using their physical side-channel emanations. 

I received my Master of Science in May 2020 from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech. Previously, I interned with Intel Corporation (Folsom, California) in summer 2018, where I worked on graphics validation, mainly display graphics for Intel Icelake for both Windows and Apple validation. 

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I obtained my Bachelor in Engineering in Electronics Engineering from VES Institute of Technology (University of Mumbai), India in 2015. During my time there as an undergrad, I worked on several projects based on embedded systems and computer architecture, including an internship at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, India, and at Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL), Mumbai, India.
